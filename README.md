# SocialWebsite
A boilerplate Social Website wih user authentication system, follow system using many-to-many relationships with an
intermediary model and user activity stream using generic relations.
I implemented AJAX views into my project using jQuery 
and built a JavaScript bookmarklet to share content from other websites on my platform.
I used django signals and created a signal receiver function to denormalize related objects counts.
I used Redis in my project to store item views,
and i built an image ranking with Redis.
